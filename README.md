Machine learning (ML) provides advanced, data-driven methods for accurate, real-time flood prediction, overcoming limitations of traditional hydrological models by analyzing historical data, rainfall patterns, and IoT sensor input. Key models include Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which improve forecasting precision, reduce false alerts, and enhance early warning systems for urban and regional flood management
